# Five-Band-Audio-Equalizer
This is a project related to module EN2091-Laboratory Practice and Projects. 
An equalizer has the ability to adjust the output of different frequency bands
within an audio signal. These circuits are widely used in hi-fi systems to achieve
superior audio quality throughout all frequency bands. In this challenge, you
are tasked to create a 5 band audio equalizer using analog electronic knowledge.
After separating the frequency band, the device should be capable of applying
a custom gain for each frequency band. The outputs of the 5 bands should be
displayed individually using a sound level indicator.
